# VR-Sign-Language-Calculator
The VR Sign Language Calculator is a virtual reality application
that uses hand tracking for input, eliminating the need for virtual
keypads. Users can perform mathematical operations by signing in
American Sign Language (ASL) to input numbers and operations.
Built using the Unity game engine for the Meta Quest 3 headset, the
system recognizes hand gestures in real-time using the XR Hands
and XR Interaction Toolkit packages. The resulting application provides
an accessible and easy-to-use interface for those both with and
without ASL experience. The calculator operates in a simple virtual
environment, providing clear feedback to guide users. Early testing
reveals that the application accurately recognizes gestures and has
potential for use in other virtual reality applications, especially
those focused on accessibility and/or immersive design.
